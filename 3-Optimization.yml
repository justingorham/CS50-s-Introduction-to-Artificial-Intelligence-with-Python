Optimization: choosing the best option form a set of options
local search: 
  - search algorithms that maintain a single node and searches by moving to a neighboring node
  - most applicable when we don't care about the path, just the solution
  - example how to place 2 hospitals in a map so that distance between any house to a hospital is minimized
state-space landscape:
  - all possible configurations of state, and a function that gives the cost of any state
  - global maximum: a single state whose value is higher than all of the other states
  - objective function: the function we're trying to maximize
  - global minimum: a single state whose value is lower than all of the other states
  - cost function: the function we're trying to minimize 
  - current state: self explanatory
  - neighbors: any node/state 1 step away from current state
