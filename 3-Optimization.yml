Optimization: choosing the best option form a set of options
local search:
  - search algorithms that maintain a single node and searches by moving to a neighboring node
  - most applicable when we don't care about the path, just the solution
  - example how to place 2 hospitals in a map so that distance between any house to a hospital is minimized
state-space landscape:
  - all possible configurations of state, and a function that gives the cost of any state
  - global maximum: a single state whose value is higher than all of the other states
  - objective function: the function we're trying to maximize
  - global minimum: a single state whose value is lower than all of the other states
  - cost function: the function we're trying to minimize
  - current state: self explanatory
  - neighbors: any node/state 1 step away from current state
Hill Climbing:
  - a local search algorithm
  - start at a state, consider the neighbors of the state. pick the highest neighbor. repeat until all neighbors are lower in value
  - same for a global minimum
  - function HILL-CLIMB(problem):
      - current = initial state of problem
      - repeat:
          - neighbor = highest valued neighbor of current
          - if neighbor not better than current:
              - return current
          - current = neighbor
  - might not always give you optimal solution. May end up with local maxima/minimum
  - flat local maximum could occur as well.
  - shoulder (flat area that's not a local max or min) may be encountered as well.
Hill Climbing Variants:
  Variant: Definition
  steepest-ascent: choose the highest-valued neighbor
  stochastic: choose randomly from higher-valued neighbors
  first-choice: choose the first higher-valued neighbor
  random-restart: conduct hill climbing multiple times
  local beam search: chooses the k highest-valued neighbors
Simulated Annealing:
  - simulating a high temperature system cooling into the solution
  - Early on, higher "temperature": more likely to accept neighbors that are worse than current state
  - Later on, lower "temperature": less likely to accept neighbors that re worse than current state
  - function SIMULATED-ANNEALING(problem, max):
      - current  = initial state of the problem
      - for t = 1 to max:
          - T = Temperature(t)
          - neighbor = random neighbor of current
          - ΔE = how much better neighbor is than current
          - if ΔE > 0:
            - current = neighbor
          - with probability e^{ΔE/T} set current = neighbor
      - return current
Traveling Salesman Problem:
  - computationally difficult
  - NP-Complete problem
  - one definition of a neighbor is switching 2 edges to (remove them and put them between the nodes that weren't connected)
