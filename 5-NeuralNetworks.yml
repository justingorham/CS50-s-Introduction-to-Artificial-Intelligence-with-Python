Neural Networks:
  - Neurons are connected to and receive electrical signals from other neurons
  - Neurons process input signals and can be activated
artificial neural network:
  - mathematical model for learning inspire by biological neural Networks
  - model mathematical function from inputs to outputs based on the structure and parameters of the network
  - allows for learning the network's parameters based on data
  - h(x_1,... x_n) = g(Î£^{n}_{i=1}{x_{i}w_{i}} + w_{0})
gradient descent:
  - algorithm for minimizing loss when training neural network
  - Gradient descent:
      - start with a random choice of weights
      - Repeat:
        - calculate the gradient based on *all data points* directing that will lead to decreasing loss
        - Update weights according to the gradient
  - Stochastic Gradient descent:
      - start with a random choice of weights
      - Repeat:
        - calculate the gradient based on *one data point* directing that will lead to decreasing loss
        - Update weights according to the gradient
  - Mini-Batch Gradient descent:
      - start with a random choice of weights
      - Repeat:
        - calculate the gradient based on *one small batch* directing that will lead to decreasing loss
        - Update weights according to the gradient
Perceptron:
  - Only capable of learning linearly separable decision boundary
multilayer neural network:
  - artificial neural network with an input layer, an output layer, and at least one hidden layer 
backpropagation:
  - algorithm for training neural networks with hidden layers
  - Backpropagation:
    - Start with a random choice of weights.
    - Repeat:
      - Calculate error for output layer
      - For each layer, starting with output layer, and moving inwards towards earliest hidden layer:
        - Propagate error back one layer
        - Update weights
deep neural networks:
  - neural network with multiple hidden layers
Overfitting:
dropout:
  - temporarily removing units - selected at random - from a neural network to prevent over-reliance on certain units
TensorFlow:
  - http://playground.tensorflow.org/
computer vision:
  - computational methods for analyzing and understanding digital images
image convolution:
  - applying a filter that adds each pixel value of an image to its neighbors, weighted according to a kernel matrix
pooling: 
  - reducing the size of an input by sampling from regions in the input
max-pooling:
  - pooling by choosing the maximum value in each region
convolutional neural network:
  - neural networks that use convolution, usually for analyzing images
feed-forward neural network:
  - neural network that has connections only in one direction
