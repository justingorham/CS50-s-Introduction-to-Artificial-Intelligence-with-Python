Probability:
Possible Worlds:
  - represented by ω
  - each world has probability represented by P(ω)
  - 0 ≤ P(ω) ≤ 1
  - Σ_{ω∈Ω} P(ω) = 1:
    - The sum of the probability of all possible worlds equals 1
Unconditional Probability:
  - degree of belief in a proposition in the absence of any other evidence
Conditional Probability:
  - degree of belief in a proposition given some evidence that has already been revealed
  - P(a|b)
  - The probability of a given 
  - Formula:
    - P(a|b) = P(a ∧ b)
    -         -----------
    -            P(b)
  - The fraction of all of the worlds where a and b is true over all of the worlds where b is true
  - Formula often expressed as:
    - P(a ∧ b) = P(b)P(a|b) 
    - P(a ∧ b) = P(a)P(b|a)
random variable:
  - a variable in probability theory with a domain of possible values it can take on
probability distribution:
  - the probability of each value for a random variable
independence:
  - the knowledge that one event occurs does not affect the probability of the other event
  - for independent variables P(a ∧ b) = P(a)P(b|a) = P(a)P(b)
Bayes' Rule:
  - Formula:
    - P(b|a) = P(b)P(a|b)
    -          ----------
    -             P(a)
  - Used in the following manner:
    - Knowing P(visible effect | unknown cause)
    - we can calculate P(unknown cause | visible effect)
