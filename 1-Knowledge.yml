knowledge: the idea tht a lot of intelligence is based on known facts; draw conclusions and reason about information
knowledge-based agents: agents that reason by operating on internal representations of knowledge
sentence: an assertion about the world in a knowledge representation language
Propositional Logic:
  - Proposition Symbols: facts about the world represented by letters such as P,Q,R
  - Logical Connectives:
      - relate proposition symbols to one another and include
      - symbols:
          - ¬ not
          - ∧ and
          - ∨  or
          - → implication
          - ↔ biconditional
      - Not (¬):
          - [P, ¬P]
          - [false, true]
          - [true, false]
      - And (∧):
          - [P, Q, P ∧ Q]
          - [true, true, true]
          - [true, false, false]
          - [false, true, false]
          - [false, false, false]
      - Or (∨):
          - [P, Q, P ∨ Q]
          - [true, true, true]
          - [true, false, true]
          - [false, true, true]
          - [false, false, false]
      - Implication (→):
          - [P, Q, P → Q]
          - [true, true, true]
          - [true, false, false]
          - [false, true, true]
          - [false, false, true]
      - Biconditional (↔):
          - [P, Q, P → Q]
          - [true, true, true]
          - [true, false, false]
          - [false, true, false]
          - [false, false, true]
model: assignment of a truth value to every propositional symbol (a "possible world")
knowledge base (KB): a set of sentences known by a knowledge-based agent
Entailment:
  - α ⊨ β
  - In every model in which sentence α is true, sentence β is also true
  - alpha entails beta
  - alpha and beta are sentences in propositional logic
inference: the process of deriving new sentences from old ones
For some query α, does KB ⊨ α?:
Model Checking:
  - To determine if KB ⊨ α:
      - Enumerate all possible models
      - If in every model where KB is true, α is true, then KB entails α.
Knowledge Engineering: the process of taking a problem and figuring out what propositional symbols to use in order to represent it logically in a computer
Propositional Symbol: a variable that can be either true or false
Model checking is not an efficient algorithm because it has to check all combination of symbols which is O(2^n):
Inference rules:
  - premise
  - ___________
  - conclusions
Modus Ponens:
  - α → β
  - α
  - __________________
  - β
And Elimination:
  - α ∧ β
  - ___________________
  - α
Double negation elimination:
  - ¬(¬α)
  - ___________________
  - α
Implication Elimination:
  - α → β
  - __________________
  - ¬α ∨ β
Biconditional Elimination:
  - α ↔ β
  - __________________
  - (α → β) ∧ (β → α)
De Morgan's Law:
  - ¬(α ∧ β)
  - __________________
  - ¬α ∨ ¬β
  - also
  - ¬(α ∨ β)
  - __________________
  - ¬α ∧ ¬β
Distributive Property:
  - might write later
Theorem Proving:
  - initial state: starting knowledge base
  - actions: inference rules
  - transition model: new knowledge base after inference
  - goal test: check statement we're trying to prove
  - path cost function: number of steps in proof
Same paradigms as search problems!!!!:
Resolution:
  1:
    - P ∨ Q
    - ¬P
    - ________________
    - Q
  2:
    - P ∨ Q
    - ¬P ∨ R
    - __________________
    - Q ∨ R
Clause:
  - a disjunction of literals
  - P ∨ Q ∨ R
Conjunctive normal form:
  - logical sentences that is a conjunction of clauses
  - (A ∨ B ∨ C) ∧ (D ∨ ¬E) ∧ (F ∨ G)
