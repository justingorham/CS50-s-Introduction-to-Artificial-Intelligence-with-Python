knowledge: the idea tht a lot of intelligence is based on known facts; draw conclusions and reason about information
knowledge-based agents: agents that reason by operating on internal representations of knowledge
sentence: an assertion about the world in a knowledge representation language
Propositional Logic:
  - Proposition Symbols: facts about the world represented by letters such as P,Q,R
  - Logical Connectives: 
    - relate proposition symbols to one another and include
    - symbols:
      - ¬ not
      - ^ and
      - v or
      - → implication
      - ↔ biconditional
    - Not (¬):
      - [P, ¬P]
      - [false, true]
      - [true, false]
    - Other Truth tables can go here
model: assignment of a truth value to every propositional symbol (a "possible world")
knowledge base: a set of sentences known by a knowledge-based agent
Entailment:
  - α ⊨ β
  - In every model in which sentence α is true, sentence β is also true
  - alpha entails beta
  - alpha and beta are sentences in propositional logic
inference: the process of deriving new sentences from old ones
